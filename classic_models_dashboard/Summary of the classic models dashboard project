I created a comprehensive Power BI dashboard to analyze sales data for classic models. I conducted data cleaning and data modeling to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the dataset. I also created visualizations to identify sales trends by product, year, and state, which facilitated actionable insights for strategic decision-making. Furthermore, I enhanced data interpretation and reporting through dynamic visual representations, contributing to an improved understanding of sales performance across different regions and time periods.
